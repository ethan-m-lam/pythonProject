Two Python Passion Projects

1. The Abandoned Building RPG: 
A rogue-like RPG with a GUI interface built on Tkinter featuring a character traversing a map, fighting enemies, and solving riddles.

2. BattleBots: 
A text-based turn-reliant battle between two tanks, one controlled by the user and the other by an algorithm.

Enjoy!
